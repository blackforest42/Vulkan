TODO:
    - add fast diffuse lighting
        - https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/real-time-cloudscapes-with-volumetric-raymarching/
        float diffuse = clamp((scene(p) - scene(p + 0.3 * sunDirection)) / 0.3, 0.0, 1.0 );

Long term:
    - how to make it interactive with mouse?
    - texture dimensions in UI?
	- add to ImGUI
		- boundary types [+/-x, y, z]
	- Remove layout transition from raymarchCmd() and call it only once after texture creation
	- Refactor DescriptorLayouts and PipelineLayouts to reuse (same layouts across most shaders)
    - micro-randomness to smoke plume position
    - use BFECC MacCormack advection
        - needs three passes: forward, backward, maccormack
