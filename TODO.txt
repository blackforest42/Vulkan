TODO: 
Compute Pipelines:
	x Add Buoyancy Pipeline
	x Vorticity Computation Pipeline
	x Vorticity Confinement Pipeline
	x Advection Pipeline (reusable for velocity, density, temperature)
	x Divergence Computation Pipeline
	- Jacobi Iteration Pipeline (pressure solve)
	- Gradient Subtraction Pipeline
	- VelocityField Boundary Pipeline
	- ScalarField Boundary Pipeline (for density, temperature, pressure)

DONE:
	- ray marching 3D texture done and tested
	- removed incoming/outgoing ray textures, replaced with simple model inversion
