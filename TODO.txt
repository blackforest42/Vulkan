TODO:
    - remaining validation errors:
        - vkmemory
        - vkimage
        - vkbuffer
        - vkpipeline
        - vkpipelinelayout
        - vkdescriptorsetlayout

    - handle resizing in fluid sim better:
        - keep texture dimensions fixed, only change rendering dims.

Long term (not ordered):
    - add fast diffuse lighting
        - https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/real-time-cloudscapes-with-volumetric-raymarching/
        float diffuse = clamp((scene(p) - scene(p + 0.3 * sunDirection)) / 0.3, 0.0, 1.0 );
    - make smoke interactive with mouse
	- Remove layout transition from raymarchCmd() and call it only once after texture creation
	- Refactor DescriptorLayouts and PipelineLayouts to reuse (same layouts across most shaders)
    - micro-randomness to smoke plume position
    - use BFECC MacCormack advection
        - needs three passes: forward, backward, maccormack
    - not happy with perf. 60 fps with 5090
        - bottleneck is in jacobi iters
