TODO:
    - fix huge smoke plume at start
Long term:
    - micro-randomness to smoke plume position
    - smoke color/intensity in UI?
    - field arrows?
	- add to ImGUI
		- boundary types [+/-x, y, z]
	- Remove layout transition from raymarchCmd() and call it only once after texture creation
	- Refactor DescriptorLayouts and PipelineLayouts to reuse (same layouts across most shaders)
