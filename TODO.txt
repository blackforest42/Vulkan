TODO:

Long term:
    - how to make it interactive with mouse?
    - texture dimensions in UI?
	- add to ImGUI
		- boundary types [+/-x, y, z]
	- Remove layout transition from raymarchCmd() and call it only once after texture creation
	- Refactor DescriptorLayouts and PipelineLayouts to reuse (same layouts across most shaders)
    - micro-randomness to smoke plume position
    - use BFECC MacCormack advection
        - needs three passes: forward, backward, maccormack
