TODO:
    - resize window crash
    - use MacCormack advection
Long term:
    - how to make it interactive with mouse?
    - texture dimensions in UI?
    - smoke intensity in UI?
    - field arrows?
	- add to ImGUI
		- boundary types [+/-x, y, z]
	- Remove layout transition from raymarchCmd() and call it only once after texture creation
	- Refactor DescriptorLayouts and PipelineLayouts to reuse (same layouts across most shaders)
    - micro-randomness to smoke plume position
    - add back buoyancy?
