TODO:
	- bug: smoke drifts diagonally even with straight upward emission.
	- continue fixing boundary cases
	- consider using a different smoke shape besides gauss splat

Long term:
	- add to ImGUI
		- boundary types [+/-x, y, z]
	- Remove layout transition from raymarchCmd() and call it only once after texture creation
	- Refactor DescriptorLayouts and PipelineLayouts to reuse (same layouts across most shaders)

// compile shader sub-directory with debug symbols (ON by default)
python3 compileshaders.py dirname
