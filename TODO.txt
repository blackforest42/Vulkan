TODO: 
- cube marching
	- need two 2D textures for front (ray entry) and back (ray exit)
	- When rendering, toggle VK_CULL_MODE_BACK_BIT/FRONT_BIT for ray entry/exit
	- in cube frag shader, write ray intersection (frag position - camera position)
	- optional: cube map
- compute shader pipeline to write to a 3d texture
	- 

DONE:
- cube mesh aka "voxel" renderer done
- turned on validation layers default for debugging
- Working ray marcher w/ perlin noise to test
- Pivoted away from voxels
- finish cloud marching clouds tutorial
